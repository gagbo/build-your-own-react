# Build your own React

This follows the content of [Pomberâ€™s Didact series](https://github.com/pomber/didact).

The main goal is that writing a bit of reactive code by hand will help me understand how redraws and things work a little bit more. And writing some vanilla JS and dom manipulation will help.


## Build

Openssl is hard

``` console
NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm ...
```

## Acknowledgement

This is basically done as a small "hack day" learning project
